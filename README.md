# Information to extract

1. Compare topic distribution between decades (temporal trends)
2. Compare topic distribution between institutions (geographic trends)
3. Find relationships(correlation, causation) between different topics
	e.g 2 topics mentioned often together
4. Most common topics(?)
5. Correlation between other readily avialable statistics (e.g percentage of people
engaging in physical activity, percentage of smokers) and diseases like obesity
6. Citation analysis
7. Fraction of articles per year on topic (temporal trends)
8. Predicting MeSH headings for new abstracts
9. Predicting trends (i.e which words will be added to the MeSH ontology)
